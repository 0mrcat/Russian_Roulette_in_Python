( So this is just a silly project nothing big )

So this is a some kind of "guess the number that i am thinking" game in Python
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
The diffrence is that u have 3 chances to guess the right number if you do not the gunshot
sound will play and it will turn off your computer :)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Becouse it is not an .exe (You can't convert it if a code is like that, and i'm to lazy to write it
from scratch) you must have colorama and Pygame installed :3 (Python too ofc)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
So yeah, have fun!
